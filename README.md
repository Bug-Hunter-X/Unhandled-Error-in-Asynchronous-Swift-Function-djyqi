# Unhandled Error in Asynchronous Swift Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in asynchronous Swift programming: insufficient error handling.  The `fetchData()` function fetches data from a remote API.  However, the error handling in the `Task` block is inadequate.  The error is simply printed to the console, leaving the application in an undefined state.

## Problem

The main issue is that the `catch` block only prints the error to the console. This is not sufficient. In a real-world application, you'd want to handle errors more gracefully, such as:

* **Retry mechanism:** Retry the network request after a delay.
* **User feedback:** Inform the user about the error.
* **Fallback mechanism:** Provide a fallback mechanism if the API request consistently fails.
* **Logging:** Log the error with additional context for debugging.

## Solution

The solution demonstrates a more robust error handling approach using a retry mechanism and providing feedback to the user.  See `bugSolution.swift` for details.
